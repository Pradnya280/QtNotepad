# QtNotepad
This is Simple Texteditor Notepad application developed using qtcreator

You can run this code in the Qt Creator application by selecting the "Run" option. In the main window, I have added a QTextEdit for text editing, and various tools have been added to the toolbars. When a widget action is triggered, certain actions will be performed.

While adding the "About Me" section for the resume dialogue, I faced challenges. Additionally, I encountered issues with the resource file as the images were not displaying properly. However, I was able to resolve these problems by seeking help from Stack Overflow and consulting ChatGPT.

The features of the Notepad include:

1.Text Editing

2.File Operations such as save, save as, copy, cut, undo, and redo

3.Text Formatting
