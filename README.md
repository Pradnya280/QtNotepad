You can run this code on qtcreator application using run option.
I have added textedit, for mainwindow and then in the toolbars various tools has been added.
After clicking on widget action will be triggered. 

while adding about me section for resume dialogue it was challenging , also faced issues during resource file as images was not showing in the resource file.
But issues resolved after getting through stackoveflow , chatgpt.
